# Bowling with Physics (Studio Assignment 2 - COSC 416)
## Nicolaas Kouwenhoven
All assignment requirements completed; Followed tutorial, implementing the game manager, input manager, player controller, ball controller, launch indicator, fall triggers, and gutters.

Only one little bug I have is that my launch indicator appears at random positions around the ball when I reset using 'R'. I am guessing this is due to the orientation of the ball object, but I am not 100% sure.
